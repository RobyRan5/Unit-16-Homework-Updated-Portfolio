<h3>Code Stars, Presents NBA Live Scores</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As NBA fans, we created an application to grab live scores standings at a glance, without having to visit the busy espn.com’s of the world.</li> 
    <li>For this project, I was directly involved with gaining our API access, building out our HTML pages and creating our live demonstration for presentation.</li>   
    <li>We used the NBA API through RapidAPI, Materalize, server side API’s, Moment.JS and JQuery.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Self-Source, Green Leads Application</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I currently work within a team at GoDaddy called the Green Leads Team. This team is specifically cold calling non-GoDaddy Customers. This team searches right now using a current workflow that takes about 1hr+ to generate 20 leads. The minimum requirement for each team member is to have 200+ leads per month. The top producer right now is averaging 1,200 self-sourced leads per month. Time and efficiency are huge bonuses as well as dedicating more hours to selling. </li>
    <li>For this project, I was the sole Full Stack Engineer and completed everything from start to finish.</li>
    <li>I used the API through Yelp, JSONWHOis and WhoAPI. REACT.JS and JQuery as well as Puppteer.</li>
